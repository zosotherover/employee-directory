As a `User` I want to be able to view my entire `employee directory` at once so that I have quick access to the `information`. 

The user should be able to sort the `table` by at least one `category`and `filter` the users by at least one `property`. 

## Objects
* User
* Employee directory
* User info
* Table
* Category
* Filter
* Property

## Components
* Header
* Filter
* Table
    * Properties(table headers)
    * Data(`User` records)
